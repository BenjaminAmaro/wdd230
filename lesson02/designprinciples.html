            <article>This is a good exemple of how visual hierarchy works, the first bigger text bring the attention of the user to the center right away, and the thing that they offer is to "grow your money" once the website took your attention you can see aditional information like invest, spend and save pricing and learn, but it is the job of the visual hierarchy to capt your attention to stay in the website long enough.</article>
